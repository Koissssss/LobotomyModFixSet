      {The Huainanzi reads, "Nüwa melted five-colored stones together to mend the sky."&#10;It is said that when Nuwa mended the sky, there were a number of five-colored stones that were abandoned, their locations left unknown. A flower was born in the crack of one of the stones, with a thin stem and narrow leaves, but the spirit of heaven and earth could be taken from the stone. Absorbing the energy within, the flower grew more and more, and was eventually able to think and speak, no different from normal people. It even began to practice taoism.}

      {This flower came to be very lonely. It had no one to accompany it within the universe, no one to befriend it but the mountains and rivers, and tens of millions of years passed by in a flash. The five-colored stone that had once supplied it with aura had also long since disappeared. As such, no matter how beautifully it bloomed, no one noticed it - perhaps, it had bloomed too early.
"Why don't I just sleep and wake up later?" The flower could hardly bear the weight of solitude, and thus decided to fall asleep. This sleep, infact, lasted for thousands of years.
When it awoke, it was in a small village. Children were playing in front of it, and smoke was slowly rising from the chimneys of nearby buildings. It could tell that it was far from the time of year it normally bloomed the brightest, so at the time it was just a small, insignificant plant. But waiting for the change of season was so insignificant compared to all the time it had endured in this life that it soon bloomed once more. The petals of the five-colored flower were crystal clear, like a glass marigold. At that time, seeing such a thing could be considered good luck, attracting the nearby villagers to see it, even those who don’t normally care for such things. Naturally, the five-colored flower had the intelligence of humans, and also the ego, and it claimed to the villagers that it was a god and demanded tribute. The villagers were horrified by the talking flower and set up an altar for the flower, taking out whatever they had that was valuable to pay tribute. But the flower knew that this wasn’t enough to convince everyone, so the five-colored flower cast a spell, emitting light from its own five-colored petals, and tinted the tribute paid by the villagers with beautiful colors...}

      {Many years have passed. The colorful flower now blossomed within a large garden, its alter. It can be carefree all day long, swaying in the wind, drinking clean water, and there are people to take care of its needs and wants. Its magic benefited the people of the village, the colorful items it created were now sought-after goods in the market, and everyone in the village was prosperous. "The Five-Colored Flower is a God!" was a belief that has been deeply rooted in the hearts of everyone. The people were lost in a life of wealth and gold, and again and again went to ask the five-color flower to cast its magic, in order to ensure that the wealth rolls in. The village was also called the "Village of Five Colors". However, the good times didn't last forever, and thieves began to plunder the village. Seeing this, the five-colored flower knew that it had embarked on a path of no return, so it instructed its "believers" to catch the thieves who had entered the village and bring them to itself. The thieves in front of the five-color flower were silent, fearing for their lives; But the Five-Colored flower spoke with kind words, coaxing the thieves and allowing them to live in the Village of Five Colors. Secretly, it cast its magic on the thieves, causing them to "reform" and enter the lives of the other villagers harmoniously. Once again, peace came to the village. After that, whenever thieves broke into the village, they all met the same fate: they lost themselves in front of the Five-Colored flower. Over time, the number of people lost to the village increased, the village became more and more prosperous, and everyone made a lot of money. Some villagers even began advertising to the outside world to promote the magic of the Five-Colored Flower, thus attracting many people one after another to the Village of Five Colors who want to find out, and invariably become lost within it.}

      {But there are already those who defy the natural order of things. There was a strange young man named Forty, who had become famous for his determination since he was a child. Neither riches nor honors could corrupt him; neither poverty nor despair could make him swerve from principle; and neither threats nor force could sway him. One day, he was asked to go and investigate the truth about the riches and wealth of the Village of Five Colors, and Forty asked a contingent of soldiers to lend him their aid and lie in wait. As soon as he entered, he felt something unusual: from furniture to livestock, almost everything was dyed in brilliant and eye-catching colors, yet ultimately there were only five colors. It was bright, sure, but compared to nature, which had many more shades in hues, it seemed scarce and unnerving. Moreso, almost everyone else in the village was enjoying themselves, except for the villagers who were acting as guides for him. Soon he arrived at the "palace" of the Five-Colored Flower, a large garden. The colorful flower was surrounded by bushes and was in full bloom. As usual, he tried to coax Forty into joining the village, while casting spells to convince him. But Forty wasn’t someone easily tricked, be it by magic or might, and these tricks were like child's play in his eyes. He simply smiled at the attempt. The Five-Colored Flower saw that he didn't budge in the slightest, and used every means it could, but it still didn't succeed.
 It was furious, and in a fit of anger, it gathered its "believers" and wanted to execute Forty on the spot, but Forty just laughed up to the sky. As it turned out, that was the signal, and the soldiers stormed the palace to kill the believers. All of them were wearing cloaks and masks, and they were not moved by the magic of the flower or its followers. The Five-Colored Flower knew that it had lost and accepted defeat. The village fell apart, and the flower was spurned by the world. Ashamed of its loss, it decided to sleep once again.&#10;}

      {……&#10;This is an Abnormality that we found within The Outskirts.&#10;When it was discovered, it was still in full bloom, although slightly dull in color. After examining the geological breaks, it was found that it has existed for well over 10 million years, and it's hard to fathom what it has experienced.&#10;According to papers found after some searching, this flower is very dangerous. Apparently, many people were lost to it, and with each lost, more and more harm was caused. As such, we have given strict orders to employees to forbid them from coming in contact with the Abnormality, and we hope that they will strictly abide by the requirements of their work, not be mesmerized by this flower, and walk out of the containment unit alive.&#10;In order to distinguish this flower from the "Five-Colored Flower" recorded in the literature, we named this flower the "Flower of Eternity", taking the meaning that its existence may well be infinite. However, it is important to note that there is no absolute eternity in this world. The five-colored flower is gone, and so are the people who were once lost, but we must learn from our mistakes - otherwise, the same tragedy will be staged within the company.&#10;……&#10;"When future generations mourn and do not learn from those before them, they also make future generations mourn again."}
