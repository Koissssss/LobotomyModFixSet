      {Momoe Nagisa was originally a magical girl who signed a contract with Kyubey. The reason for becoming a magical girl was so that her dying mother could eat cheese cake. Later, she regretted not directly rescuing her mother as she had made her wish. After transforming into a witch, she became Charlotte, the confection witch. In the world without witches created by Madoka Kaname after becoming a god, she was redeemed by the "Principle of the Ring" before becoming a witch. She accepted the witch "in order to eat cheese again" like Miki Sayaka. She embarked on a mission to break away from the cause and effect of the world and became the messenger of the "Principle of the Circle".}

1: Ragdoll-like initial state, expressionless.
2: A big worm comes out of the mouth of the first form. It has a body with red polka dots on a black background, and one red and one blue wing on each side of its head (useless).}

Instead of summoning weapons to attack, she summons various familiars (the familiars of all witches in the old world) to fight through an infinite cycle of "face-changing". In addition, she can also use her own weapon, the trumpet-shaped bubble machine, to blow out some bubbles to hinder enemies or attack.}

After hatching, he became the confection witch Charlotte, and fought against Mami Tomoe brought by Madoka in the barrier. After being restrained by Tomoe Mami in her initial form, she transformed a second time and bit off Tomoe Mami's head and devoured it, and was later eliminated by Akemi Homura who arrived.}
