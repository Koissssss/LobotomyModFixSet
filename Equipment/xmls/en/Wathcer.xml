<text id="Watcher_weapon_desc">A dark gray scythe.
The eyes on the scythe are like reliefs, but you can faintly feel that they are staring at you.
It will watch your every move all the time, and its words and deeds will also affect its damage.
To use this weapon, its user must be a righteous gentleman whose mind, words and deeds are as clear as a mirror, and everything he does is righteous.
Although this weapon is not as powerful as other E.G.O weapons, it can judge the soul of the attacked in another way.
However, for those villains who lack a sense of justice, the weapon may even dislike him and completely fail to exert its maximum strength.</text>
<text id="Watcher_armor_desc">Attacking an Abnormality with a gun is as meaningless as cutting water with a knife.
Even the swords and mountains of fire could not hurt them at all.
But they attack humans as easily as crushing an ant.
But the mind is mankind's most powerful weapon.
If you use the power of your mind properly, you will be invincible.
